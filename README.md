# Beilin's AI and Machine Learning Project Portfolio

## 1) Group Projects

### [Project 1: Machine Learning-Based Optimization of US Car Insurance Premiums](https://github.com/BeilinYe/DS_Car_Insurance_Premium_Setting)
* Analyzed factors influencing car insurance claim amounts using two datasets, applying predictive modeling techniques such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes.
* Achieved an R² value of 96% for the more complex dataset, indicating strong predictive performance, particularly with the Decision Tree and Naive Bayes models.
* Conducted feature importance analysis to identify key predictors, emphasizing the significance of vehicle information and accident details in predicting claims.
* Provided actionable insights for insurance companies to optimize pricing strategies and improve risk management based on data-driven findings.
