# Beilin's AI and Machine Learning Project Portfolio

## 1) Group Projects

### [Project 1: Machine Learning-Based Optimization of US Car Insurance Premiums](https://github.com/BeilinYe/DS_Car_Insurance_Premium_Setting)
**Project Motivation**  
Analyzed factors affecting car insurance claim amounts to help insurers optimize pricing and manage risk.

**Project Accomplishments and Results**  
- Developed predictive models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes) on two datasets.
- Achieved an RÂ² value of 96% using advanced techniques like Decision Trees and Naive Bayes.
- Identified key predictors (vehicle info, accident details) using feature importance analysis.
- Delivered actionable insights for pricing strategy optimization.

**Technical Skills**  
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
- Machine Learning models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes


### [Project 2: AI-Powered SME Stock Prediction with LSTM, ESN, and Tree-Based Approaches](https://github.com/BeilinYe/DS_SME_Stock_Price_Prediction)
**Project Motivation**  
- Addresses the lack of effective tools for investors in small to medium-sized U.S. companies.
- Leverages AI and machine learning to provide reliable stock market projections.

**Project Accomplishments and Results**  
- Conducted market needs assessment to identify user needs and translate them into engineering requirements.
- Identified market needs for supporting investor decision-making.
- Successfully identified and evaluated five candidate models (LSTM, ESN and tree-based approaches) for SME stock price prediction, with Echo State Networks (ESN) emerging as the most effective solution. The ESN achieved an RMSE of 12.79 for 1-day predictions and maintained excellent efficiency, demonstrating superior performance compared to other models despite a decrease in accuracy for 10-day predictions.

**Technical Skills**  
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Machine Learning models: LSTM, Echo State Networks, Tree-Based Models  
- User-centered design process


### [Project 3: AI-driven Image Restoration Using Optimization Techniques](to be updated)

**Project Motivation**
This project explored the integration of Split Bregman Iteration and Anisotropic Total Variation (ATV) to improve image restoration tasks, focusing on denoising and extending it to inpainting.

**Project Accomplishments and Results**
- Implemented the Split Bregman-ATV and Isotropic Total Variation (ITV) methods for denoising noisy images.
- Achieved high-quality restoration on images with low-to-moderate noise levels.
- Extended the SB-ATV approach to inpainting, demonstrating its effectiveness on partially missing images.
- Quantified results using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and relative error, confirming the superiority of ATV over ITV in most cases.

**Technical Skills**
- MATLAB
- Image processing techniques: Denoising, Inpainting
- Optimization methods: Split Bregman Iteration
- Mathematical models: Anisotropic and Isotropic Total Variation
